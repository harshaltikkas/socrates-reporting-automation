#  @SmokeTests
#  Scenario Outline: Single or Multiple Selection of class Dropdown
#  Given User is on portal's login screen with username as "superadmin" and password as "password" 
#    When within the Universal Selector Tab "<usertype>" with "<singleormultipleclass>" selection of class click on roster tab 
#    Then by default "All" student should be selected and "<usertype>" with "<singleormultipleclass>" should be able to select Student drop downlist
#    And verify class list and school list and student lastname starts in alpha order 

#  Examples: 
#      | 	usertype  				|	singleormultipleclass	|
#      | Student  				  |												|																														
#      | Teacher  				  |		single							|
#      | Teacher  		 			|		multiple						|
#      | School Admin 	 		|												|

#This will fail because UI is not implemented as requirement.
